INHERIT THE EARTH

null

Native Sons do not just live on the earth, they inherit it. They let its soil slowly sift through their fingers as they examine the texture. They feel the chill of its mountain air bring them fully alive as it enters their lungs. Gliding through its waters on their craft of choice, they feel an overwhelming since of calm and smallness in contrast to the magnitude of the amazing world they are blessed to inhabit.
